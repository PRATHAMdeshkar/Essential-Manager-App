3. things to be added/enhanced in the app: 

in Remainder sectionn: the past remainder/alarm should be disabled or should move to history tab as we are doing for item list, we can make 2 pats of history as we are currently storing the history the of product that we check "puchesed" under the current date lable similary we can make the 2nd section in history tab for past notification (so it will also a type of task list or work done list for later referance),
